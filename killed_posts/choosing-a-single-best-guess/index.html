<p>The purpose of this blog is to explore how we can reason about what we know to make guesses about what we don’t. We are going to “dip our toes” into this subject by exploring one of the most commonly experienced concepts in probability theory and statistics: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency">measures of central tendency</a>. We are going to revisit the common definitions of measures such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean">mean</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)">mode</a>; and we will attempt to build a stronger intuition of what they are and why they are useful in our goal of making better guesses.</p>
<p>Before we begin, we are going to frame our discussion in terms of trying to win a particular guessing game.</p>
<div id="the-guessing-game" class="section level1">
<h1>The Guessing Game</h1>
<p>Suppose we are asked to participate in a guessing game. We are asked to predict what number will be printed on a ball drawn from a bin containing 50 numbered balls. The next ball will be drawn “randomly”, that is to say in a manner that makes any ball equally likely to be drawn. Note however that this does not mean that the numbers printed on the balls are equally likely i.e. some numbers appear on more balls than others.</p>
<p>Let’s make this setup concrete by creating a bin of balls in R.</p>
<p>First some setup that will aid us through the rest of this post.</p>
<p>Next, we will actually create our bin of numbered balls. Note: we are arbitrarily choosing to sample from a geometric distribution as it has features we will find useful in our exploration.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># generate 50 samples from a geometric distribution with parameter prob = 1/5
x &lt;- rgeom(n = 50, prob = 1/5)

print(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  2  2 12  0  5  1  2  6  6  0  2 15  5 12  2  0  0  4  0  9  1  0  0
## [24]  5  6  3  4  5  3  1  0  6  2  7  1  3  0  2  4  1  0  4  3  6  1  4
## [47]  3  1  2  0</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see the balls in our bin. Some numbers occur more than others. Perhaps a better way of viewing this is by plotting how frequently we see each number in our bin:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = x)) +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(x),max(x))) + 
  labs(x = &#39;printed number&#39;, y = &#39;count of balls with printed number&#39;) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-17-choosing-a-single-best-guess_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We note that ggplot has conveniently included values between our minimum and maximum printed number that occur zero times. The frequency of occurance is closely related to the concept of probability, (in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability">frequentist school</a> probability and frequency are one in the same). We can see this relationship by normalizing the counts to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by the counts by the total number of balls.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = x, ..count../sum(..count..))) +
  theme_minimal() +
   scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(x),max(x))) + 
   scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
  labs(x = &#39;printed number&#39;, y = &#39;probability of balls with printed number&#39;) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2019-02-17-choosing-a-single-best-guess_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Here we see the normalized counts. For our purposes these normalized counts aka relative frequencies represent the probability that the given number will be drawn next (again, based upon the setup of our game). We now know how much more likely one printed number is than another.</p>
<p>Can we now choose a number as a guess?</p>
</div>
<div id="the-mode" class="section level1">
<h1>The Mode</h1>
<p>Our first attempt at a reasonable guess might be the printed number that is the most likely to occur, that is the the printed number with the highest probability. In our case, the printed number with the highest probability is 0 with a probability of 22%. Further justification of the mode as our choice can be found from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, where we can interpret the mode as being the least <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content">“surprising”</a> of all the outcomes i.e. the outcome we most expect.</p>
<p>While the mode is easy to determine in our case, we may come across probability distributions that have multiple modes (called bimodal for two modes, and multimodal generally), no modes, or even an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncountable_set">uncountably infinite</a> number of modes. Despite this, the mode can still be a very useful guide to making a reasonable guess, but it is by no means the only choice, nor always the right choice.</p>
