<p>Greetings and salutations wonderful humans,</p>
<p>For those who have been following the blog, you may have noticed that my previous posts are no longer available. This is because I am rebooting the blog. I felt that the posts up until now strayed too far away from the central theme of the blog, and felt far less polished than I would like. Additionally, I focused too much on mathematical notation and theory, and not enough on inutition and application (let alone featuring more code!). I will make my old posts available again, once I ensure that they are up-to-snuff and map better to the concepts I want to focus on.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns feel free to <a href="mailto:wctelson@gmail.com">email me</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding,</p>
<p>David</p>
