$$r = \frac{w}{sc}$$

$$s_0 = \frac{w}{r_0c}$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{s_0}{s} &= \frac{\frac{w}{r_0c}}{\frac{w}{rc}} \\ 
\\
&= \frac{w}{r_0c}{\frac{rc}{w}} \\ 
\\
&= \frac{r}{r_0}
\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$ E\Big(\frac{S_0}{s}\Big) = E\Big(\frac{R}{r_0}\Big) = \frac{1}{r_0}E(R)$$

$$P\Big(\frac{R}{r_0} = \frac{r}{r_0}\Big) = P(R = r)$$

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# days to simulate
D <- 10000

mu <- 20

phi <- .25

# units of work per day
w <- 1 + rgeom(n = D, prob = 1/(mu))

# work content per unit of work (in working days). Work content is the inverse of resource capability c
y <- rexp(n = sum(w), rate = 1/phi)

# index of days for each y
i <- rep(1:D, w)

# performance standard
s = 2

sum_y_d <- tapply(X = y, INDEX = i, FUN = sum)

new_r_d <- sum_y_d/s

r_d <- map_dbl(1:D, function(d){
    
    sum(new_r_d[pmax(d-s+1,1):d])
    
    })

# qplot(1:D, ceiling(r_d), geom = 'step')

qplot(ceiling(r_d))

mean(r_d)
mu * phi

# our conjecture predicts s_0/s = r/r_0

r0 <- 4

mean(r_d/r0)

# in our to demonstrate the validity of the conjecture, we want to construct an algorithm that simulates the processing of workloads given an allocation of resources.

# let's create a resource that has 10 day blocks

worker_capacity <- rep(1,10)

# let's create some work that will take up some time

work_content <- rexp(100, rate = 1/.25)

# I need to step away and think about this for a bit.
