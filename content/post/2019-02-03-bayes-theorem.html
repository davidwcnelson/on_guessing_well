<p>This post will explore Bayes’ theorem, and its applicability to our problem of making good guesses.</p>
<p>The definition of conditional probability. <span class="math display">\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}\]</span></p>
<p>Getting a conjunction from conditional probability. <span class="math display">\[ P(A,B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)\]</span></p>
<p>Bayes’ theorem. <span class="math display">\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]</span></p>
<p>The law of total probability. <span class="math display">\[P(B) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}P(B,A_j)\]</span></p>
<p>Bayes theorem with the law of total probability. <span class="math display">\[ P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}\]</span></p>
<p>Continous bayes theorem.</p>
