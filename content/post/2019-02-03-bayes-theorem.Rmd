This post will explore Bayes' theorem, and its applicability to our problem of making good guesses. 


The definition of conditional probability.
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$$

Getting a conjunction from conditional probability.
$$ P(A,B) = P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)$$

Bayes' theorem.
$$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

The law of total probability.
$$P(B) = \sum_{j=1}^{n}P(B,A_j)$$

Bayes theorem with the law of total probability.
$$ P(A_i|B) = \frac{P(B|A_i)P(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(B|A_j)P(A_j)}$$

Continous bayes theorem.
