This post is an attempt to express the general theme of this blog: "how can we make good decisions under uncertainty?", or as I prefer "how can we guess well?" As a working Data Scientist, my principal role is to support decision makers by recommending a set of actions (alternatively, a "course" of action) they can take that will help them achieve their goals. Which course of action should I recommend? Intuitively, the course of action I recommend should be the one I think is most likely to achieve a decision maker's desired goal.
