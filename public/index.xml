      <description>This post is an attempt to express the general theme of this blog: “how can we make good decisions under uncertainty?”, or as I prefer “how can we guess well?” As a working Data Scientist, my principal role is to support decision makers by recommending a set of actions (alternatively, a “course” of action) they can take that will help them achieve their goals. Which course of action should I recommend?</description>

      <description>Greetings fellow humanoid!
My name is David W.C. Telson and this blog is all about decision making under uncertainty. We will be exploring all sorts of topics from the realms of probability theory, decision theory, statistics, machine learning, and the philosophy of science.
At present I am a Data Scientist working for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, DC. Most of the problems I work on involve leveraging machine learning and statistics to support decisions about the Agency&amp;rsquo;s incident workforce and field operations.</description>
