      <description>One of my absolute favorites books is Probability: the Logic of Science by E.T. Jaynes. The book was published posthumously in 2003, after Jayne’s death in 1998. While the book presents a compelling philosophical argument for probability theory, it is known to be incomplete and to contain errors. Despite this, I think it is a very important work in the history of probability theory, and a great foundation for how one can reason with incomplete information.</description>

      <title>Reasoning via Deduction, Induction, and Abduction</title>

      <description>My last post was an introduction to deductive reasoning, that is reasoning via deductive argument. I wanted to briefly outline two other forms of reasoning so we can compare and contrast their merits, as well as identify their usage.
Deduction As we stated in our last post, deduction is reasoning that, given premises, guarantees the truth of its conclusion. Two major forms of deduction are “Modus Ponens” and “Modus Tollens”.</description>

      <title>Probability in a Finite and Deterministic Universe</title>

      <description>My previous post got me thinking about the nature of infinity. It lead me to a thought provoking post by Steve Patterson on logical errors regarding infinite sets. While I haven’t taken enough time to fully appreciate his logic, it got me thinking about how probability relates to metaphysics and epistemology. Steve’s claim is that modern mathematics has made a mistake with regards to infinity, specifically that by definition a set cannot be infinite (or else it would be finite), and thus arguments built on this premise are unsound (though the logic, granting the premise may be valid).</description>

      <title>Some Oddities of the Principle of Insufficient Reason</title>

      <description>We are keenly interested in reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information i.e. how we should make a “best guess” given that we have imperfect knowledge. One of the classical tools in our tool belt is the so called “principle of insufficient reason” also known as the “principle of indifference”. More on the history and extensions of the principle, but for now I want to focus on some oddities that occur by trying to reason with the principle.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Workload Modeling</title>

      <description>The Purpose of this Post This post presents a brief introduction to workload modeling. For our purposes we define workload modeling as “an effort to usefully represent the relationship between A) the demand for products (or services), B) the production (or service delivery) process, C) and the requirement for resources”. This should be taken as a working definition, as we are sure that our own investigation into this subject will shape and change our fundamental understanding in the future.</description>

      <title>A First Attempt w/ Central Tendency</title>

      <description>The purpose of this blog is to explore how we can reason about what we know to make guesses about what we don’t. We are going to “dip our toes” into this subject by exploring one of the most commonly experienced concepts in probability theory and statistics: measures of central tendency. Specifically, we are going to revisit the common definitions of measures such as the mean, median, and mode; and attempt to build a stronger intuition of what they are and why they are useful in our goal of making better guesses.</description>

      <description>Greetings fellow humanoids,
My name is David W.C. Telson and this blog is all about decision making under uncertainty. We will be exploring all sorts of topics from the realms of probability theory, decision theory, statistics, machine learning, and the philosophy of science.
At present I am a Data Scientist working for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Washington, DC. Most of the problems I work on involve leveraging machine learning and statistics to support decisions about the Agency&amp;rsquo;s incident workforce and field operations.</description>
