      <description>We are keenly interested in reasoning with incomplete or uncertain information i.e. how we should make a “best guess” given that we have imperfect knowledge. One of the classical tools in our tool belt is the so called “principle of insufficient reason” also known as the “principle of indifference”. More on the history and extensions of the principle, but for now I want to focus on some oddities that occur by trying to reason with the principle.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Workload Modeling</title>

      <description>The Purpose of this Post This post presents a brief introduction to workload modeling. For our purposes we define workload modeling as “an effort to usefully represent the relationship between A) the demand for products (or services), B) the production (or service delivery) process, C) and the requirement for resources”. This should be taken as a working definition, as we are sure that our own investigation into this subject will shape and change our fundamental understanding in the future.</description>

      <title>A First Attempt w/ Central Tendency</title>

      <description>The purpose of this blog is to explore how we can reason about what we know to make guesses about what we don’t. We are going to “dip our toes” into this subject by exploring one of the most commonly experienced concepts in probability theory and statistics: measures of central tendency. Specifically, we are going to revisit the common definitions of measures such as the mean, median, and mode; and attempt to build a stronger intuition of what they are and why they are useful in our goal of making better guesses.</description>
